This documents list a series of resources for learning the Python programming language. It is aimed at beginners. This is intended to be living document, which will be gradually updated.

Briefly Python is a general-purpose scripting language, which I think is one of the better starting off points for learning about imperative languages.

Should form a sound basis for moving on to other languages like JavaScript or C# if one desires.

Switching language is, of course, not necessary as Python can be used for pretty for much anything, be it web development, apps or data science.

# Installation
First step is to install the Python language engine itself. This is the program that actually executes python scripts. Simply go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and grab the lastest version installer for whatever OS you're using.

# Editors
Second step is to choose an editor. This is the program you will actually be writing code with. While python code itself is simply text and can be generated with any text editor (like notepad on Windows), it is highly recommended to get a proper editor, with code execution, syntax highlighting and other features that will make your life easier.

Below is couple that could be good candidates:

* Sublime https://www.sublimetext.com/
* Atom https://atom.io/
* Pycharm https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
* VSCode https://code.visualstudio.com/

Pycharm is probably the better starting point, as it comes with a debugger and an easy way to install modules and extensions.

# Installation Guide

Setting up Python and Pycharm is covered pretty nicely by the first 5 minutes of this Programming with Mosh Python for Beginners video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8&t=361s.

For setting Python with VSCode Corey Schafer has a very detailed guide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nh9rCzPJ20&list=PL-osiE80TeTt66h8cVpmbayBKlMTuS55y&index=9.

# Video Lessons

Programming with Mosh, Python for Beginners covers the basics of the Python language as well as how to set it up https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8&t=361s.

Corey Schafer has a wide range of excellent tutorials on the language itself as well as various Python framesworks. For the language basics we have this video series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg&list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7.

Corey Schafer also covers the Flask framework, which is used for developing webapps in Python. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH

Corey Schafer also covers the Django framework, which is another popular framework for develping webapps in Python. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p
